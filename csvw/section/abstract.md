# Abstract

This document provides an overview of the CSVW reference formulation and its natural RDF mappings. The CSVW reference formulation describes how to access and reference data within CSV data sources by column name. The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting CSV data types into their corresponding RDF literals, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with RDF standards.
