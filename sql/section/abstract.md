# Abstract

This document provides an overview of the SQL reference formulation and its natural RDF mappings. The SQL reference formulation describes how to access and reference data within SQL data sources by column name. The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting SQL data types into their corresponding RDF literals, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with RDF standards.
