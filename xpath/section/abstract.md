# Abstract

This document provides an overview of the XPath reference formulation and its natural RDF mappings. The XPath reference formulation describes how to access and reference data within XML data sources using XPath. The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting native XML data types into their corresponding RDF literals, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with RDF standards.
